<p>What is this? Whatever we make it!</p>

<p>A place for startup founders and aspiring scale entrpreneurs around Scotland to gather.</p>

<p>Peer support, discussions and meetups - we're considering what will help the most.</p>

<p>
  We are working to make an in-person place to gather where like-minded people can share their thoughts or questions.
  A place designed to help us all succeed better. Celebrate the highs and carry each other through the lows.
  <br><br>
  We are currently talking to the University of Edinburgh about our first location!
</p>

<p>In the meantime we exist online - <a href="https://discord.gg/W4CRkUACQX">join the discussion</a> on Discord</p>
