<p>A place for startup founders and aspiring scale entrpreneurs around Scotland to gather.</p>

<p>Peer support, discussions and meetups - we're considering what will help the most.</p>

<p>
  We are working to make an in-person place to gather where like-minded people can share their thoughts or questions.<br>
  A place designed to help us all succeed better. Celebrate the highs and carry each other through the lows.
</p>

<p>
  The group usually meets on a Wednesday.<br> From 9-4 you will find some of us in one of the open spaces at the
  <a href="https://efi.ed.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Futures Institute</a>.<br>
